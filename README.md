🌍 Predicting Air Quality Levels Using Advanced Machine Learning Algorithms for Environmental Insights

This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to predict air quality levels based on historical environmental data. The goal is to provide actionable insights to mitigate the impact of air pollution.

📌 Project Objectives
Analyze and preprocess air quality datasets.

Develop machine learning models to predict air pollutant levels (e.g., PM2.5, PM10, NO₂).

Evaluate and compare model performance.

Visualize environmental trends and prediction outcomes to aid public awareness and policy.

📊 Features
